# Arcanea Security Fixes

This directory contains security fixes for critical vulnerabilities discovered during the API security audit conducted on 2026-02-02.

---

## What's Inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` | Step-by-step guide to implement all fixes |
| `analytics-route-SECURED.ts` | Fixed version of analytics endpoint with authentication |
| `sanitization-IMPROVED.ts` | Comprehensive input sanitization library |
| `rate-limit-IMPROVED.ts` | Production-ready distributed rate limiting |

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

1. **Unauthenticated Analytics Access** (CRITICAL)
   - Analytics endpoint exposed sensitive data without authentication
   - Fixed by adding admin-only authentication

2. **In-Memory Rate Limiting** (HIGH)
   - Rate limits reset on server restart
   - Fixed with distributed Redis-based rate limiting

3. **Weak Input Validation** (HIGH)
   - Prompts could contain injection attacks or malicious content
   - Fixed with comprehensive validation and sanitization

4. **Basic XSS Prevention** (MEDIUM)
   - Simple HTML stripping wasn't sufficient
   - Fixed with DOMPurify and proper sanitization

5. **Missing CSRF Protection** (MEDIUM)
   - Cross-site request forgery possible
   - Fixed with CSRF token validation

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Read the Audit Report

Start by reading the full security audit report:

```bash
/mnt/c/Users/frank/Arcanea/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

This contains:
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Security posture analysis
- File-by-file security assessment
- Risk analysis

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @upstash/ratelimit @upstash/redis isomorphic-dompurify csrf-csrf
```

### 3. Setup Environment

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Upstash Redis for rate limiting
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-token

# CSRF protection
CSRF_SECRET=your-random-secret-at-least-32-characters
```

### 4. Follow Implementation Guide

Open `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` and follow the step-by-step instructions.

## Priority Order

### P0 - Deploy Immediately (Day 1)
- Fix 1: Add authentication to analytics endpoint (2 hours)
- Fix 2: Implement distributed rate limiting (4 hours)

### P1 - Deploy This Week (Day 2-3)
- Fix 3: Enhanced prompt validation (2 hours)
- Fix 4: Upgrade XSS sanitization (3 hours)
- Fix 5: Add CSRF protection (4 hours)

### P2 - Deploy Next Sprint (Week 2)
- Fix 6: Add security headers (1 hour)
- Fix 7: Implement audit logging (2 hours)

**Total time**: 18 hours (~2-3 days of focused work)

---

## Testing

After implementing fixes, run these tests:

```bash
# Test authentication
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics
# Should return 401

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/generate-video \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"prompt": "test"}' &
done
# Should see 429 on later requests

# Test XSS prevention
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/comments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"content": "<script>alert(1)</script>test"}'
# Should sanitize script tag

# Test injection detection
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"message": "'; DROP TABLE users;--"}'
# Should return 400 validation error
```

## Verification Checklist

After deploying all fixes:

### Authentication
- [ ] Analytics endpoint requires authentication
- [ ] Admin role required for analytics access
- [ ] Invalid tokens return 401
- [ ] Access attempts are logged

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Rate limits work across server restarts
- [ ] Different users have separate limits
- [ ] 429 responses include Retry-After header
- [ ] Rate limit headers present in responses

### Input Validation
- [ ] SQL injection attempts blocked
- [ ] XSS attempts sanitized
- [ ] Excessively long prompts rejected
- [ ] Malicious patterns detected and logged

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] POST without CSRF token returns 403
- [ ] GET requests work without CSRF token
- [ ] Valid CSRF tokens allow mutations

## Risk Assessment

### Before Fixes

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| Data exposure via analytics | CRITICAL | High | High |
| Rate limit bypass | HIGH | Medium | High |
| Prompt injection attacks | HIGH | Medium | High |
| XSS attacks | MEDIUM | Medium | Medium |
| CSRF attacks | MEDIUM | Low | Medium |

### After Fixes

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| Data exposure via analytics | LOW | Low | Low |
| Rate limit bypass | LOW | Low | Low |
| Prompt injection attacks | LOW | Low | Low |
| XSS attacks | LOW | Very Low | Low |
| CSRF attacks | LOW | Very Low | Low |

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate rollback** available via Git:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```

2. **Partial rollback** for specific features:
   - Rate limiting: Set `IN_MEMORY_FALLBACK=true` temporarily
   - CSRF: Disable CSRF middleware temporarily
   - Validation: Reduce strictness temporarily

3. **Emergency bypass** (use only if necessary):
   ```bash
   # Disable rate limiting
   export DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true

   # Disable CSRF
   export DISABLE_CSRF=true
   ```

3. Test in development environment
4. Deploy P0 fixes to production
5. Implement P1 fixes (validation + CSRF)
6. Schedule P2 fixes for next sprint

**Security is a journey, not a destination.**

These fixes address the immediate vulnerabilities, but security requires ongoing attention:
- Regular security audits
- Dependency updates
- Monitoring and logging
- Incident response planning
- Security training for team

Stay vigilant. Stay secure. 🛡️
