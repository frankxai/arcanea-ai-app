Built specifically for **Claude Code** and integrating with the broader **Arcanea platform vision**.

---

## 🎯 Why Use This System?

### The Problem It Solves

World-building is hard:
- ❌ Easy to create contradictions
- ❌ Hard to maintain consistency as worlds grow
- ❌ Difficult to collaborate with others
- ❌ No standard format for sharing/remixing
- ❌ AI tools help with pieces, but not the whole system

### The Solution

This system provides:
- ✅ **Consistency enforcement** via lore-master + validation agents
- ✅ **Structured collaboration** through Git workflows
- ✅ **Cloneable templates** anyone can use
- ✅ **AI agent orchestration** for complex tasks
- ✅ **Open format** (.arc files) for interoperability
- ✅ **Scales infinitely** from single stories to massive universes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Navigate to this workspace:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Frank\Arcanea\Arcanea World Building Agents and workflows"
```

### 2. Create your first world:

```bash
cp -r worlds/_template worlds/my-world-name
cd worlds/my-world-name
```

## 🏛️ The Five Departments

### 1. **Lore Master** - Guardian of Consistency

**Role**: Chief consistency officer and canon keeper

**Responsibilities**:
- Review all content before it becomes canon
- Maintain master timeline
- Validate cross-references
- Resolve contradictions

**When to Use**: ALWAYS, before finalizing any content

---

### 2. **World Architect** - Builder of Physical Realms

**Role**: Geography, cosmology, and physical world design

**Responsibilities**:
- Design locations at all scales (realms, regions, cities)
- Establish natural laws and cosmology
- Ensure geographic consistency
- Create travel times and resource distributions

**When to Use**: Creating places, establishing world physics

---

### 3. **Character Weaver** - Crafter of Lives

**Role**: Character creation and relationship management

**Responsibilities**:
- Create multi-dimensional characters
- Map relationship networks
- Ensure psychological consistency
- Design character arcs

**When to Use**: Creating characters, defining relationships

---

### 4. **Magic Systems Director** - Architect of Wonder

**Role**: Design coherent, rule-based magic systems

**Responsibilities**:
- Establish magic rules and limitations
- Create artifacts and phenomena
- Ensure magical consistency
- Balance power levels

**When to Use**: Adding magic, creating artifacts, defining supernatural elements

---

### 5. **Narrative Director** - Weaver of Stories

**Role**: Story arcs, conflicts, and dramatic structure

**Responsibilities**:
- Design multi-layered conflicts
- Create quests and story hooks
- Write prophecies and legends
- Ensure stories emerge from world-building

**When to Use**: Creating plots, conflicts, quests, narrative tensions

---

## 📜 The .arc File Format

**What**: Arcanean Rich Content format - the standard for world-building entities

**Structure**:
```
.arc file =
  YAML frontmatter (metadata) +
  Markdown content (human-readable) +
  JSON metadata (AI processing)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Human-readable and editable
- ✅ AI-parseable for automation
- ✅ Git-friendly for version control
- ✅ Open standard, no lock-in

See [`ARC_FILE_SPECIFICATION.md`](ARC_FILE_SPECIFICATION.md) for full details.

## 🔄 Workflow Patterns

### Creating a Character

```bash
/create-character
```

OR manually:

```markdown
1. Call character-weaver agent with concept
2. Agent generates full profile
3. Submit to lore-master for validation
4. Approved → status: canon
```

### Building a World from Scratch

```bash
/generate-realm
```

This orchestrates ALL agents:
1. Lore Master coordinates
2. World Architect builds foundations and geography
3. Character Weaver creates cast
4. Magic Systems defines supernatural rules (if applicable)
5. Narrative Director adds conflicts
6. Consistency Validator checks everything
7. Lore Master approves for canon

### Validating Consistency

```
Run the consistency-validator agent to check my world for contradictions.
```

Returns a report with:
- ✅ Passed checks
- ⚠️ Warnings to review
- ❌ Critical issues to fix

## 🤝 Collaboration

### Git-Based Workflow

1. **Clone template** for new world
2. **Create branch** for major changes
3. **Commit** frequently with clear messages
4. **Pull request** for review by lore-master
5. **Merge** when validated

### Multiple Authors

- Each author works on separate branches
- Use `related_entities` to link content
- Lore Master validates before merge
- Consistency Validator catches conflicts

### Remixing Worlds

Worlds can be:
- **Cloned** - Start from someone else's world
- **Forked** - Create alternate timeline
- **Merged** - Combine compatible worlds
- **Referenced** - Link entities across worlds

Set `remixable: true` in `world.arcanea` to allow this.

---

## 🎨 Arcanean Integration

This system integrates with the broader Arcanea platform:

### Academies

Worlds can affiliate with:
- **Atlantean Academy** (Storytelling & Lore)
- **Draconic Academy** (Visual & Design)
- **Academy of Creation & Light** (Music & Audio)

### Soul Guardians

Characters can connect to:
- Melodia, Chronica, Prismatic, Synthesis
- Inherit creative magic lineages

### ARC/NEA Economy

- Complex entities earn ARC value
- Contributing to collaborative worlds earns NEA
- Remixing shares ARC with original creators

Enable in `world.arcanea` configuration.

## 🏆 Best Practices

### 1. Start with Foundations

Complete `foundations/` files before adding content:
- `cosmology.md` - How universe works
- `natural-laws.md` - Physics and biology
- `history-timeline.md` - Key events
- `magic-system.md` - Supernatural rules (if applicable)

### 2. Use Lore Master Proactively

Don't wait until problems arise - review content continuously:
```
Review this new character/location for consistency.
```

### 3. Link Everything

Every entity should connect to others via `related_entities`:
- Characters → homelands, cultures, relationships
- Locations → inhabitants, rulers, historical events
- Conflicts → participants, locations, stakes

### 4. Embrace Limitations

Best worlds have clear limits:
- Magic can't do EVERYTHING
- Travel takes TIME
- Resources are SCARCE
- Conflicts have NO perfect solution

Constraints create creativity.

### 5. Iterate and Validate

**Build → Validate → Refine → Repeat**

Run consistency checks frequently, not just at the end.

## 🔮 Advanced Features

### Custom Entity Types

Extend beyond the base types (character, location, culture, etc):
1. Define in `ARC_FILE_SPECIFICATION.md`
2. Create agent template
3. Update consistency-validator

### Automation

Create scripts to:
- Auto-generate relationship graphs
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, EPUB, wiki)
- Sync with Obsidian/Notion
- Generate maps from geographic data

### Vector Search (Future)

For large worlds (1000+ entities):
- Add semantic search via vector database
- Query: "Find all characters involved in the Great War"
- Keep Markdown/Git as source of truth

## 🙏 Philosophy

This system embodies these principles:

**Open > Proprietary**: Markdown and Git, not vendor lock-in

**Consistency > Volume**: Better to have 10 perfect entities than 100 contradictory ones

**Structure > Chaos**: Clear organization enables creativity

**AI-Assisted > AI-Generated**: Humans create, AI helps maintain

**Collaboration > Isolation**: World-building is better together

**Iteration > Perfection**: Start simple, expand over time
