## Specific Improvements

### Priority 1: Fix AI Tics
```diff
- "delve into the mysteries"
+ "explore the mysteries"

- "the tapestry of creation"
+ "the art of creation"
```

### Priority 2: Add Context for Jargon
```diff
- Kira opened her Fourth Gate
+ Kira opened her Fourth Gate—the Gate of Heart,
+ at 417 Hz, where love and healing intersect
```

### Priority 3: Strengthen Stakes
Line 78 tells us Kira fears failure. Show it instead:
- Add a physical reaction (trembling hands, racing heart)
- Show a memory of past failure
- Add internal conflict

## Quick Actions

Would you like me to:
1. [ ] Auto-fix AI verbal tics
2. [ ] Generate contextual jargon expansions
3. [ ] Run 7-pass revision protocol
4. [ ] Compare against similar Luminor-rated content
```

## Integration with Other Commands

```bash
# Full quality workflow
/arcanea-name-check content.md    # Check names first
/arcanea-eval content.md          # Evaluate quality
/revise content.md                # 7-pass revision
/arcanea-eval content.md --compare # Re-evaluate and compare
```

## Calibration Examples

**Luminor (81-90) Example**: "The First Dawn" - Founding myth with rich canon integration, no AI tics, clear thematic arc.

**Master (61-70) Example**: "Age of Open Gates" draft - Good concepts, needs revision for voice and accessibility.

**Apprentice (0-50) Example**: First drafts, brainstorms, raw ideas - Not failures, just early stage.
