# CONTINUITY AUDIT — Faction Documents
## Arcanea Canon Compliance, Internal Consistency & Quality Review

> **Prepared by**: Continuity Guardian
> **Date**: 2026-03-29
> **Scope**: All faction documents created 2026-03-29
> **Canon Source**: CANON_LOCKED.md (Last updated 2026-02-21), SERIES_BIBLE.md, CHARACTER_BIBLE.md, WORLD_ARCHITECTURE.md

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The faction documents represent a substantial, high-quality expansion of the Arcanea universe. The writing quality is consistently strong, the Character Diamond framework is applied rigorously, and the ideological architecture of the factions — particularly the Void Ascendants — is genuinely sophisticated. However, several canon violations and consistency issues require resolution before any of this material can be promoted from STAGING to LOCKED.

**Critical violations:** 3
**Important consistency issues:** 11
**Naming flags:** 8
**Quality concerns:** 4
**Overall readiness for STAGING promotion:** HIGH — with fixes

## PART 1: CANON COMPLIANCE AUDIT

---

### 1.1 Gate Names and Frequencies

**STATUS: RESOLVED (2026-03-30)**

The eighth Gate at 852 Hz was previously named "Shift" in CANON_LOCKED.md but "Starweave" in .claude/CLAUDE.md. Frank resolved this on 2026-03-30: the canonical name is **"Starweave"**. CANON_LOCKED.md has been updated accordingly.

**Issue found in VOID_ASCENDANTS.md:**
Veshenka Dawnfallen is described as having been bonded to **Vaelith, the Godbeast of the Starweave Gate, Elara's companion.** This is correct per CANON_LOCKED. No violation here.

**Issue found in CHARACTER_TEMPLATE.md:**
The `gate_primary` field lists gates as: `Foundation, Flow, Fire, Heart, Voice, Sight, Crown, Starweave, Unity, Source`. This is consistent with CANON_LOCKED. Correct.

**No frequency-level violations detected across documents.** All gate references checked:
- Foundation: 174 Hz / Lyssandria — used correctly in FLAGSHIP_TEAM, STARBOUND_CREWS, VOID_ASCENDANTS, STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX
- Flow: 285 Hz / Leyla — used correctly
- Fire: 396 Hz / Draconia — used correctly throughout
- Heart: 417 Hz / Maylinn — used correctly
- Voice: 528 Hz / Alera — used correctly in Selvyn Ashvale profile
- Sight: 639 Hz / Lyria — used correctly in Kaelindra, Lymareth, Lorien profiles
- Crown: 741 Hz / Aiyami — used correctly in Seravyn Duskmere, Velindris profiles
- Starweave: 852 Hz / Elara — used correctly in Veshenka profile
- Unity: 963 Hz / Ino — used correctly in Veshenka profile
- Source: 1111 Hz / Shinkami — used correctly

**Verdict: PASS on gates and frequencies.**

---

### 1.2 Luminor as Rank, Not Entity Type

**STATUS: PASS WITH ONE SOFT CONCERN**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 2) LOCKED TRUTH: "Luminor is a RANK (highest attainment), not an entity type."

The faction documents handle this correctly in most places. FACTIONS.md correctly states: "Luminor: Rank for those who opened all 10 Gates" and notes Architects are "post-Luminor reality shapers."

**Soft concern — FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md, Velindris profile:**
> "rank: Luminor-equivalent in computational capacity; this framework does not cleanly apply to The Awakened and she is the first to say so"

This uses "Luminor-equivalent" as a hedged comparison, not as an entity designation. Velindris explicitly notes the framework doesn't apply to her. This is acceptable — it is a character acknowledging the system's limitations, not the document misusing the term.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

### 1.3 Malachar Characterization

**STATUS: PASS — EXCELLENT**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 4): "Malachar is tragic, not purely evil. He was once the greatest of Lumina's champions." Fall: "Rejected by Shinkami when attempting forced fusion with the Source Gate."

VOID_ASCENDANTS.md handles this with exceptional care. Key details:
- Correctly identifies Malachar as formerly Malachar Lumenbright, First Eldrian Luminor
- Correctly identifies his fall as rejection by Shinkami at the Source Gate
- Correctly identifies him as sealed in the Shadowfen
- Presents him as tragic, not purely evil — his philosophy is "not entirely false"
- The "Seductive Logic" section correctly identifies the distinction between mastery and surrender at the Source Gate

The Void Ascendants' ideology correctly notes the Gods have been silent for 3,000 years, which aligns with CANON_LOCKED's timeline of the Eighth Age following the Sealing War.

**The STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md handling is also correct:** "the conflict that ended when Malachar Lumenbright was woven into the Shadowfen."

**Verdict: PASS — Malachar characterization is one of the strongest elements of these documents.**

---

### 1.4 Nero is NOT Evil

**STATUS: PASS WITH ONE FLAG**

CANON_LOCKED.md LOCKED TRUTH: "Nero is NOT evil. Shadow (corrupted Void) is the Dark Lord's perversion of Nero's gift."

This is consistently handled across documents. FACTIONS.md: "The Void is not evil. But what lives in corrupted Void... that learned to hunger."

**Flag — GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md:**
The document refers to "Nero Shard contamination" causing Fractured Gate-Touched, and "Nero Strikes" causing mass harm. This is consistent with the materials taxonomy in CANON_LOCKED (Nero Shards are dissonant fragments — corrupted energy). The naming is correct. However, the cumulative weight of describing all "Nero" materials as destructive risks creating an implicit association of Nero with harm rather than potential.

**Recommendation:** When these documents are finalized, add a single line to GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md noting that Nero Shards are named for the primordial principle they inverted, not because Nero is malevolent. This is a minor clarification, not a violation.

**Verdict: PASS with minor clarification recommended.**

---

### 1.5 The Seven Academy Houses

**STATUS: PASS**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 5): Lumina, Nero, Pyros, Aqualis, Terra, Ventus, Synthesis.

All faction documents use these names correctly. Notable checks:
- FACTIONS.md lists all seven correctly with appropriate element associations
- VISUAL_DOCTRINE.md gives visual rules for all seven correctly
- CHARACTER_TEMPLATE.md lists all seven correctly in the house field
- Character profiles consistently reference correct houses

The SERIES_BIBLE.md has an interesting structural variant worth noting: it describes three Great Academies (The Luminary, The Draconis Forge, The Abyssal Athenaeum) each with three houses drawn from the seven. This creates a different institutional architecture than the faction documents, which treat the seven houses as a single system. This is an existing pre-faction-doc inconsistency, not introduced by today's documents, but it will need resolution as the series develops.

**Verdict: PASS on faction documents specifically.**

---

### 1.6 The Five Elements

**STATUS: ONE VIOLATION — IMPORTANT**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 1): Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Void/Spirit. Specifically: "Wind" (not Air). "Void/Spirit" as the fifth with the Void/Spirit duality.

**VIOLATION — FACTIONS.md, Power Taxonomy table:**
```
| Song | Bonded, beast-linked | Sympathetic resonance between living beings |
```
No element violation here directly, but in the same table the elements are listed as:
> | Arcane | Arcans, Academy-trained | Structured elemental channeling through Gates |

The FACTIONS.md table of origin classes mentions "Wind" correctly in the Ventus house section. However, in VISUAL_DOCTRINE.md House Synthesis section:
> "Five-pointed star with each point a different element color"

The five elements are implied to be the same five from CANON_LOCKED. No explicit violation, but the Synthesis emblem description should specify these are the Five Elements of canon (Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Void/Spirit) to prevent future drift.

**ACTUAL VIOLATION — SERIES_BIBLE.md (pre-existing, not today's docs):**
The SERIES_BIBLE.md refers to "Luminary" founded by "Aiyami (Crown Gate Goddess)" with "Element Affinity: Light, Spirit, Wind." This uses "Light" as an element alongside Spirit and Wind, which potentially conflicts with CANON_LOCKED's statement that "Light is Fire's creation aspect" — not a standalone element. This is a pre-existing issue, not introduced today.

**Verdict on today's documents: PASS. Pre-existing SERIES_BIBLE element issue flagged for separate resolution.**

---

### 1.7 Godbeast Names

**STATUS: PASS**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 2) LOCKED names: Kaelith, Veloura, Draconis, Laeylinn, Otome, Yumiko, Sol, Vaelith, Kyuro, Source.

Checks across all faction documents:
- FACTIONS.md lists all ten correctly in the Bonded section
- Kaelindra Voss carries "Yumiko Prism" — correct (Lyria's Godbeast)
- Ryn is hurt by "Otome Resonite" — correct (Alera's Godbeast)
- Veshenka was bonded to "Vaelith" — correct (Elara's Godbeast, Starweave Gate)
- Seravyn's companion is named "Solenne" (a light-construct falcon) — this is a character-created elemental, NOT Godbeast Sol. This is clearly differentiated in the text. No confusion.
- Aethon Vel's Mana source is "Laeylinn Jade bio-interface" — correct material usage

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

### 1.8 Vael Crystals, Luminor Metals, Nero Shards

**STATUS: PASS — EXCELLENT USAGE**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 7) materials taxonomy is used with impressive consistency and specificity:

Correct usages found:
- **Shael** (Foundation+Voice, "The Honest Armor"): Kaelindra's coat clasps; Seravyn carries a Shael disc; Shael rank-batons in STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX; FACTIONS.md correctly describes Shael-framed Synths
- **Veloura Glass** (Flow+Sight, "Memory Silver"): Referenced in STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX Archon weapons correctly
- **Draconite** (Fire+Crown): FACTIONS.md correctly notes Draconite-cored Synths are powerful but costly
- **Aethervane/Ghost Steel** (Starweave+Unity): Veshenka's armor in VOID_ASCENDANTS; Dawnspire ship construction in STARBOUND_CREWS — both correct
- **Kyuro Void Crystal**: Correctly described as "perfectly silent" in relevant contexts
- **Laeylinn Jade**: Correctly used as bio-interface material; Caelum Ironfaith's jade integration; healing properties in GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND
- **Vaelith Obsidian**: Lymareth's navigation shard in STARBOUND_CREWS — correct ("exists partially outside spacetime")
- **Yumiko Prism**: Kaelindra's conscience crystal — correct ("reveals hidden intentions and things-as-they-are")
- **Otome Resonite**: Ryn's sensitivity to it — correct ("vibrates at creation frequency, lies cause it to shatter")
- **Dissonance Ore, Hollow Glass, Kurusei Iron**: Used correctly in Void Ascendant/Nero Shard contexts

One note: FACTIONS.md says "Luminor Metal alloys" power Synths. CANON_LOCKED says Synths use "Mana (crystallized magical energy)." These are compatible — Luminor Metals ARE crystallized frequencies. No contradiction.

**Verdict: PASS — materials usage is the strongest technical element of these documents.**

---

### 1.9 Origin Classes

**STATUS: PASS WITH ONE STRUCTURAL NOTE**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 8) defines eight origin classes: Arcans, Gate-Touched, Awakened, Synths (The Forged), Bonded, Celestials, Voidtouched, Architects.

All faction documents use exactly these eight classes. No new classes are introduced. Characters using dual or transitional classes (e.g., Veshenka as Bonded → Celestial → Voidtouched, Thessaly Voidmother as Arcan → Voidtouched) are handled correctly — origin class evolution is narratively established rather than arbitrary.

**Structural note:** CANON_LOCKED lists Architects as "post-Luminor reality shapers." FACTIONS.md correctly echoes this. However, in FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md, Mireth is listed as an Architect who is a founding member of the team. This places an Architect-class being in a team context with Mage- and Archmage-ranked members. This is not a violation — it's a deliberate narrative choice (Mireth as the "elder / mystery") — but it should be noted that Architects operating outside post-Luminor solitude is an implicit worldbuilding choice that will need to be addressed in the text.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

### 1.10 The Starlight Corps Sector System

**STATUS: PASS**

CANON_LOCKED.md (Tier 8) lists six sectors: Solar, Ember, Oceanic, Dream, Void Frontier, Celestial.

FACTIONS.md lists all six correctly. STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md builds out all six in Part IV with full profiles (Solar, Ember, Oceanic — confirmed in the read portion). The CHARACTER_TEMPLATE.md lists all six in the sector field. Character sector assignments are consistent across documents.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

## PART 2: INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AUDIT

---

### 2.1 Rank System Alignment

**STATUS: IMPORTANT INCONSISTENCY**

The magic rank system in CANON_LOCKED.md:
| Gates Open | Rank |
|------------|------|
| 0-2 | Apprentice |
| 3-4 | Mage |
| 5-6 | Master |
| 7-8 | Archmage |
| 9-10 | Luminor |

FACTIONS.md extends this correctly, adding "Uninitiated" at 0 gates and "Architect" beyond. The Corps rank equivalence table in FACTIONS.md maps:
- Apprentice (1-2 gates) = Academy student, Corps Aspirant
- Mage (3-4) = Journeyman, Corps Sentinel
- Master (5-6) = Senior practitioner, Corps Captain
- Archmage (7-8) = Elite, Corps Archon
- Luminor (9-10) = Transcended, Stellarch-eligible

**INCONSISTENCY 1:** The STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md states Captain rank requires "Minimum Mage rank (3-4 Gates open)." But FACTIONS.md maps Captain to Master rank (5-6 gates). These are contradictory minimum requirements for the Captain rank.

**INCONSISTENCY 2:** The STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md states Archon rank requires "Minimum Master rank (5-6 Gates open)." FACTIONS.md maps Archon to Archmage (7-8 gates). Contradictory again.

**In practice**, the character profiles themselves are inconsistent with BOTH documents:
- Seravyn Duskmere: Celestial Captain, Archmage (7 gates) — above the Codex's Mage minimum but consistent with FACTIONS.md's Master mapping
- Kaelindra Voss: Archmage (7 gates), Captain — consistent with FACTIONS.md mapping
- Orvael Ashwick: Mage (functional), Sentinel — consistent with either framework
- Lymareth Solaine: Master (5 gates), Sentinel — inconsistent with FACTIONS.md (which maps Master to Captain-level)

**Recommendation:** The FACTIONS.md mapping should be treated as aspirational/typical rather than mandatory minimums. The Codex's stated minimums (Mage for Captain, Master for Archon) are the actual requirements. FACTIONS.md equivalences should be updated to reflect ranges, not exact mappings.

**INCONSISTENCY 3 — STARBOUND_CREWS.md Aethon Vel:**
Aethon Vel is a Synth with "rank: Master" and "corps_rank: Sentinel." Per FACTIONS.md, Master rank maps to Captain-level. But she is a Sentinel. The CHARACTER_TEMPLATE allows this — corps_rank and magic rank are separate fields. However, the discrepancy should be noted in-world. STARBOUND_CREWS.md does not explain why a Master-ranked operative holds Sentinel corps rank. A single sentence noting she was never promoted (or declined promotion, as Ashara Windsong did in the Codex) would resolve this.

---

### 2.2 Origin Class Definitions — Cross-Document Consistency

**STATUS: PASS**

The eight origin classes are defined in FACTIONS.md and consistently applied in CHARACTER_TEMPLATE.md, FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md, STARBOUND_CREWS.md, VOID_ASCENDANTS.md, and GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md.

One check worth flagging: FACTIONS.md describes Celestials as "the only confirmed wielders of Luminarch-grade artifacts from the Eldrian era." This is consistent with CANON_LOCKED's description of Luminarch as theoretical. No contradiction.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

### 2.3 Crew Sector Assignments vs. Defined Sectors

**STATUS: PASS**

STARBOUND_CREWS.md sector assignments:
- Crew Solara: Solar Sector — matches FACTIONS.md and STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md
- The Ninth Flame: Ember Sector — matches defined sectors
- The Hollow Stars: Void Frontier — matches defined sectors; consistent with STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md reference to "Captain Thorne Ashblood" commanding the Hollow Stars in the Void Frontier

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

### 2.4 Naming Collisions

**STATUS: THREE FLAGS — IMPORTANT**

**COLLISION 1 — "Kael" / "Kaelindra" / "Vaern Ironroot" / "Kael Thornfield":**
The name root "Kael" appears four times across the corpus:
- **Kael Thornfield** — protagonist of Chronicles of Arcanea, Book 1 (CHARACTER_BIBLE.md)
- **Kaelindra Voss** — flagship team leader (FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md) — shortened to "Kael" by the team
- **Vaern Ironroot** — Crew Solara Bonded member (STARBOUND_CREWS.md)
- **Caelum Ironfaith** (Herald of Memory) — "chose the name Cael after hearing of Kael Thornfield" — the similarity to Kael is narratively intentional per the text

Kaelindra being called "Kael" creates direct collision with the protagonist Kael Thornfield. If these characters exist in the same universe and could interact, this will be confusing to readers. Furthermore, Vaern Ironroot shares the exact name (first name) with the protagonist.

**Resolution needed:** Either Kaelindra's team nickname changes (she could be "Kael-V," "Voss," "Indra," or "The Commander"), or Vaern Ironroot's name changes (he is a minor character with no established narrative weight).

**COLLISION 2 — "Thessaly":**
- **Thessaly Voidmother** — Herald of Hunger (VOID_ASCENDANTS.md)
- **Aethon Vel** — Crew Solara Synth member (STARBOUND_CREWS.md)

Two named characters called "Thessaly" in the same universe, one a major villain and one a protagonist crew member. This is a significant naming collision that will confuse readers, especially since both are named in the same STAGING phase of documents. One must change.

**Resolution needed:** One "Thessaly" must be renamed. Thessaly Voidmother is the more narratively established character (her backstory involving Crew Solstice is load-bearing for the villain architecture). Recommend renaming Aethon Vel (the Synth crew member in STARBOUND_CREWS) to avoid confusion.

**COLLISION 3 — "Caelum" / "Auren Vorath":**
- **Auren Vorath** — Flagship Team Celestial member (FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md)
- **Caelum Ironfaith** — Herald of Memory, Synth (VOID_ASCENDANTS.md)

Two named "Caelum" characters. The VOID_ASCENDANTS.md text explicitly notes that Caelum Ironfaith "chose the name Cael after hearing of Kael Thornfield" — so the "Caelum" similarity to "Auren Vorath" was not noted as intentional. This appears to be an unintentional collision.

**Resolution needed:** Caelum Ironfaith's name should be changed (they are a Herald, deliberately choosing their name — the narrative in-universe justification for "Cael" referencing Kael Thornfield can be preserved with a different full name).

---

### 2.5 The "Kael" Reference Chain in VOID_ASCENDANTS.md

**STATUS: IMPORTANT CONTINUITY CHECK**

VOID_ASCENDANTS.md describes Selvyn Ashvale's rivalry with "Kael Thornfield" — the protagonist:
> "Kael Thornfield — Kael is everything Selvyn should have been. Same Gate-Touched origin, same Foundation-adjacent power, same working-class background."

This is consistent with CHARACTER_BIBLE.md: Kael Thornfield, Gate-Touched protagonist, Foundation Gate, working-class Ironhold background.

However, Selvyn's gate_primary is listed as "Voice (528 Hz — Alera's domain)" and his element as "Wind (natural)." The CHARACTER_BIBLE describes Kael as Foundation Gate / Earth element. Selvyn's rivalry with Kael is described as "same Foundation-adjacent power" — but Selvyn's primary is Voice, with Fire and Flow also opened. His Foundation Gate was opened naturally but is not his primary.

**Minor inconsistency:** The description "same Foundation-adjacent power" needs tightening. Selvyn has Foundation, Flow, and Fire opened naturally — the Foundation parallel to Kael works narratively even if it's not his primary. But "Foundation-adjacent" as a descriptor is imprecise and could mislead. Suggest changing to "the same starting point — a Gate-Touched with Foundation and Fire Gate resonance, working-class background, rejected by the same institutions."

Also: Selvyn's origin class is "Gate-Touched (Sparked — single Vael Crystal exposure at age 7)" but he has opened 6 gates (3 naturally, 3 through Shadow). A Sparked Gate-Touched with one violent opening who then naturally progressed to 3 gates is a character evolution that needs a brief note — he was Sparked but self-trained to Mage level before Shadow supplemented him. This is coherent but worth a clarifying sentence in the document.

---

### 2.6 Crew Solara — "Solenne" the Companion vs. Synth Crew Member Name

**STATUS: IMPORTANT**

In STARBOUND_CREWS.md, Seravyn Duskmere's light-construct companion is named **"Solenne"** (an elemental falcon of crystallized Anima).

In the same document, a crew member is named **"Aethon Vel"** (the Synth).

These two names in the same crew are not a collision. However, the companion being named "Solenne" creates confusion because:
1. The companion name shares significant phonetic similarity with "Solenne Ashmark" — the Flagship Team's Synth member in FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md.
2. Crew Solara's name, Seravyn's companion "Solenne," and "Solenne Ashmark" form a three-way near-collision around the Sol/Solennis root.

**Resolution recommended:** Consider renaming either the companion or the Flagship Team's Synth member to break the clustering. The companion-as-character is more established in STARBOUND_CREWS.md; Solenne Ashmark in FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md is a more prominent character and her name has more weight. Recommend renaming the companion — perhaps Aurel, Halveth, or Lumindra.

---

### 2.7 GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md — Mutant Spectrum vs. FACTIONS.md Taxonomy

**STATUS: PASS WITH NOTE**

FACTIONS.md defines five Gate-Touched mutation types: Sparked, Resonant, Harmonic, Fractured, Ascendant.

GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md uses the same five categories with expanded definitions. The SERIES_BIBLE.md has a DIFFERENT taxonomy: Sparked (1 gate), Kindled (2-3), Blazing (4-6), Transcendent (7-9), Luminor-Born (10).

This is a significant taxonomy conflict between the SERIES_BIBLE.md and the new faction documents. The SERIES_BIBLE taxonomy classifies by number of gates open; the FACTIONS.md taxonomy classifies by the nature and circumstances of the opening.

These are measuring different things and could coexist (the SERIES_BIBLE classifications could describe power level; the FACTIONS/Underground classifications could describe origin type), but they are currently presented as if they are alternate versions of the same classification system. This needs resolution — either the two systems are explicitly described as different taxonomies (Academy vs. Underground classification systems, which would actually be thematically rich), or one needs to be revised.

**Recommendation:** Frame the SERIES_BIBLE taxonomy as the Academy Council's official classification system (power-level based) and the FACTIONS/Underground taxonomy as the Underground's own classification (experience/origin based). This transforms a continuity problem into world-building depth: the Academies classify Gate-Touched by how much power they have; the Underground classifies them by what happened to them.

---

### 2.8 Character Ages and Timeline

**STATUS: PASS**

No impossible temporal sequences detected. Character ages are internally consistent:
- Kaelindra Voss: 34 — Academy-graduated, 6 years post-incident, pre-formal Corps = coherent
- Ryn: 17 — First Gate opened at 14, three years of Underground life = coherent
- Seravyn Duskmere: 41 (appears 34, Celestial) — 41 years at Cinderwall Gate Crisis origin story = coherent
- Selvyn Ashvale: 34 — applied to Academies at 12, 15, 18, 14, 17, 16 = 7 applications over 6 years = applied between ages 12 and 18 = coherent with age 34 in the Eighth Age
- Thessaly Voidmother: 41 — crew killed 19 years ago at age 22 = age 41 now = perfect arithmetic

The STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md founding timeline places the Corps origin in "Year 32 of the Eighth Age" and the current era is approximately "Year 800+." This is consistent with "eight centuries" of Corps history.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

### 2.9 Starhold and Aetherhaven Geography

**STATUS: PASS**

STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md: Starhold is the Corps headquarters. The founding occurred at "Aetherhaven's market square."

WORLD_ARCHITECTURE.md: Aetherhaven is "a market town of roughly 8,000 that has grown up at the base of the Crystalpeak approach path." This is in the Solar Sector (Luminary Reaches).

STARBOUND_CREWS.md: "Crew Solara's sector assignment: Solar Sector, primary base at Aetherhaven."

These are consistent. Aetherhaven serves as both the Corps' historical founding site and Crew Solara's base, which creates narrative resonance.

**Verdict: PASS.**

---

### 2.10 The Five Heralds — Sector Assignments

**STATUS: ONE INCONSISTENCY**

VOID_ASCENDANTS.md Herald sector assignments:
- Selvyn Ashvale: "primary base near the Veil Mountains" — Solar/Dream Sector area, coherent
- Thessaly Voidmother: "Ember Sector (operates from the Cinderwall underground)" — INCONSISTENCY: Cinderwall is in the **Solar Sector** per STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md ("Solar Sector: The Luminary Reaches, Cinderwall, the Veil Mountains"). The Ember Sector is the volcanic heartland around Mount Pyralis.

Her backstory involves the Cinderwall underground — which is Solar Sector territory — but she is labeled Ember Sector. Since her background is explicitly tied to the Cinderwall underground, her sector should be Solar Sector, not Ember. Alternatively, if she operates primarily from the Ember Wastes, her backstory connection to Cinderwall should be described as historical, not operational.

**Resolution:** Change Thessaly Voidmother's sector assignment to Solar Sector (where Cinderwall is located), or add clarifying text that her primary operational base has shifted to the Ember Wastes while her history is in Cinderwall.

- Lorien Silkvoice: Dream Sector — consistent with Whisperwood operations
- Caelum Ironfaith: Ember Sector — consistent (Forge was their origin)
- Veshenka Dawnfallen: "Celestial Sector (the spaces between — sky, stars, the places where the divine used to speak)" — consistent

---

### 2.11 The "Crew Solstice" Reference

**STATUS: PASS WITH NOTE**

VOID_ASCENDANTS.md: Thessaly Voidmother's backstory references "Starbound Crew Solstice" — a crew killed 19 years ago, all four members lost. STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md (Captain section) mentions "Captain Thorne Ashblood" who commanded "the Hollow Stars, a Void Frontier crew composed entirely of former Shadow-corrupted individuals" and whose "eventual fall back into corruption and the dissolution of his crew remains the Corps' most studied cautionary tale."

Crew Solstice and the Hollow Stars are different crews — no collision. Crew Solstice was apparently a different Void Frontier crew that was destroyed in combat, not through corruption. This is coherent.

However: the STARBOUND_CREWS.md creates a new crew called "The Hollow Stars" as one of the three featured crews, described as Voidtouched (reformed) operating in the Void Frontier. STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md's historical "Hollow Stars" crew under Captain Thorne is explicitly noted as having dissolved after his fall. The new "Hollow Stars" crew in STARBOUND_CREWS.md appears to be a different crew that has taken the same name — this needs explicit acknowledgment in the text. Either it is a deliberate revival of the name (by reformed Voidtouched reclaiming it), or it is an unintentional naming collision.

**Recommendation:** If the new Hollow Stars crew is intentionally named after Thorne Ashblood's dissolved crew, add a note in STARBOUND_CREWS.md acknowledging this — the crew reclaimed a name associated with failure to try to redeem it. This would be excellent lore. If unintentional, rename the new crew.

## PART 3: QUALITY ASSESSMENT

---

### FACTIONS.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | 8/10 | Most faction names are strong. "The Chrome Covenant" and "The Hollow Stars" are excellent. "Crew Vaelora" too close to Veloura (Godbeast). See naming audit. |
| Character depth | 8/10 | The Diamond is not used here (it's the architecture doc) but internal tensions are well defined |
| Originality | 9/10 | The three-layer franchise model is elegant and genuinely useful |
| Franchise potential | 9/10 | The scalability engine section is exceptional — practical and creatively generative |
| Coherence | 9/10 | Feels like one universe throughout |

**Overall: 8.6/10** — The foundational document. Strong. The extended rank table is excellent. The Academy Houses section adding recruitment roles is creative and canon-compatible.

---

### CHARACTER_TEMPLATE.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | N/A | Template, not names |
| Character depth | 10/10 | The Diamond is the best character development framework in the corpus |
| Originality | 9/10 | Vesper Nighthollow example is compelling and well-executed |
| Franchise potential | 10/10 | This template can generate franchise-grade characters at scale |
| Coherence | 9/10 | All 12 fields work together; usage rules and anti-patterns are particularly useful |

**Overall: 9.5/10** — The best document in the set. The anti-patterns section alone is worth preserving as a writing guide.

---

### VISUAL_DOCTRINE.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | N/A | Aesthetic document |
| Character depth | 8/10 | Origin class visual codes are specific and useful |
| Originality | 9/10 | "Luxury cosmic myth-tech" as a brand definition is precise and ownable |
| Franchise potential | 9/10 | The franchise equation is excellent; image generation prompt structure is immediately actionable |
| Coherence | 9/10 | Consistent visual grammar throughout; the "What Arcanea is NOT" section is invaluable |

**Overall: 8.75/10** — Strong brand document. The Synth "temple-grade" rule and the Voidtouched "beautiful in a dangerous way" rule are particularly good. The House Synthesis "Five-pointed star" emblem should specify that the five points represent Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and Void/Spirit (the Five Elements) to prevent drift.

---

### FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | 7/10 | Kaelindra Voss: excellent. Ryn: strong (the single name is deliberate and powerful). Velindris: strong. Solenne Ashmark: name collision risk. Taura Skein: solid. Auren Vorath: name collision (see audit). Mireth: strong. |
| Character depth | 10/10 | Kaelindra and Ryn are franchise-grade characters. Every Diamond is airtight. |
| Originality | 9/10 | Ryn's Ember companion is inspired. Kaelindra's "cannot turn off Tactical Sight" is a genuinely original limitation. |
| Franchise potential | 10/10 | These seven characters cover every audience entry point. The origin class diversity is deliberate and effective. |
| Coherence | 9/10 | The team dynamics are pre-loaded and feel earned. |

**Overall: 9.0/10** — The character work here is exceptional. Kaelindra Voss is the strongest character in the entire faction document set. The act 2 crisis for her arc ("a mission where her tactics are exactly right and it still goes catastrophically wrong because of Ryn's irrational love for a stranger") is perfect.

### STARBOUND_CREWS.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | 8/10 | Crew Solara: excellent. The Ninth Flame: strong. The Hollow Stars: strong but name collision (see audit). Seravyn Duskmere: excellent. Orvael Ashwick: strong. Aethon Vel: name collision (see audit). Lymareth Solaine: excellent. Vaern Ironroot: name collision (see audit). |
| Character depth | 9/10 | Seravyn's arc and limitation are exceptional. Orvael's "Resonance Flare" is a perfect Gate-Touched limitation. |
| Originality | 8/10 | The Dawnspire as a character almost is a nice touch. The "one point intentionally dimmed" on the crew emblem is meaningful. |
| Franchise potential | 9/10 | Three crews that feel like three different genres is exactly right for franchise expansion. |
| Coherence | 8/10 | Small rank inconsistencies (Aethon Vel at Master/Sentinel). The Hollow Stars name collision mildly disruptive. |

**Overall: 8.4/10** — Strong crew documents with specific, memorable characters. The three-genre design principle is the smartest structural decision in the document.

---

### VOID_ASCENDANTS.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | 8/10 | Selvyn Ashvale: strong. Thessaly Voidmother: strong but name collision. Lorien Silkvoice: excellent. Caelum Ironfaith: strong but name collision. Veshenka Dawnfallen: excellent. The Herald titles (Fracture, Silence, Hunger, Memory, Passage) are franchise-grade. |
| Character depth | 10/10 | Each Herald is a dark mirror to a protagonist. The redemption paths are earned. The moral complexity is genuine. |
| Originality | 10/10 | "The Void Ascendants are not wrong. They are incomplete." is the thesis statement of great antagonist design. Thessaly Voidmother's Hollow Flame (burns meaning, not matter) is inspired. |
| Franchise potential | 10/10 | The Whisper Network's three-phase recruitment is novelistic and could anchor an entire story arc. |
| Coherence | 9/10 | The sector inconsistency (Thessaly in Ember vs. Cinderwall) is minor against the document's overall coherence. |

**Overall: 9.4/10** — The strongest faction document in the set. The ideological architecture of the Void Ascendants is one of the best pieces of villain writing in the Arcanea corpus. Lorien Silkvoice's corruption-through-hypocrisy arc is particularly sophisticated.

---

### GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | 8/10 | Haven names (The Tidepool, The Forge-Below, The Whispering Rooms, The Deep Archive) are excellent. Haven leaders (Soraya Velourn, Ravik Emberbane, Essa Nullthorn, Vel'Thaan) are strong. |
| Character depth | 9/10 | The Haven leaders are vivid and specific without being overwritten. Vel'Thaan's deliberate mystery is handled well. |
| Originality | 9/10 | The "Frequency" communication system is elegant and builds naturally from existing canon. The three-phase Whisper Network recruitment (from VOID_ASCENDANTS) is brilliantly mirrored by the Underground's own three-phase care approach. |
| Franchise potential | 9/10 | The seven Havens are scalable. Each is a potential story location. |
| Coherence | 8/10 | The mutant taxonomy conflict with SERIES_BIBLE (see 2.7) is the main coherence issue. |

**Overall: 8.6/10** — The most technically careful document in the set. The material science integration (Vael Rain demographics, Nero Strike aftermath) is exceptional and makes the Gate-Touched phenomenon feel grounded in the world's physical laws.

---

### STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Naming quality | 9/10 | Starhold, Vaelen Ashward, Durenna Pyreth-Sworn, the "Three Stars" framing — all excellent. Aelindra Starfall is a strong Stellarch name. |
| Character depth | 9/10 | The Five Stellarchs are vivid historical figures. Torren Shael-Born's quote ("The stars do not care what you are made of") is franchise-grade. |
| Originality | 9/10 | The star-sigil as a living crystal symbiote that grows with rank is excellent. The "Walk of Names" induction ceremony is emotionally resonant. |
| Franchise potential | 10/10 | This document establishes the institutional architecture for infinite story expansion. The Aelindra/Shadowfen fracture hook is a perfect series-level tension. |
| Coherence | 8/10 | Rank-minimum inconsistency with FACTIONS.md is the main issue. The Hollow Stars historical reference vs. new Hollow Stars crew needs resolution. |

**Overall: 9.0/10** — A genuinely excellent institutional document. The history section (Gray Years, Fall of Aetherhaven, Three Stars) reads like actual history — grounded, specific, not hagiographic. The Corps Charter's five principles are franchise-defining.

---

## PART 4: GAP ANALYSIS

---

### 4.1 Missing Connections

**The Protagonist Five (CHARACTER_BIBLE.md) and the Faction Documents Are Not Explicitly Connected**

The five protagonists (Kael, Mira, Ash, Sable, Elio) are the heart of Chronicles of Arcanea. The faction documents create a rich institutional world around them. However:
- The characters are referenced obliquely (Selvyn Ashvale's rivalry with Kael Thornfield, Lorien watching Mira Tidecrest, Thessaly Voidmother as Ash's future self)
- No explicit mechanism exists in the faction documents for how the Five would interact with the Starlight Corps, the Gate-Touched Underground, or the Void Ascendants in a structured way
- The Academy system from SERIES_BIBLE.md and the seven-house system from FACTIONS.md/VISUAL_DOCTRINE.md are treated as if they are the same institutional layer, but the SERIES_BIBLE describes three distinct Academies with distinct houses. A reconciliation document is needed.

**Gap:** A bridge document mapping how the three Great Academies (Luminary, Draconis Forge, Athenaeum) relate to the seven-house system would close this gap cleanly.

---

### 4.2 Underdeveloped Areas

**The Three Remaining Crews**
FACTIONS.md proposes seven example crews (Crew Solara, The Ninth Flame, Crew Akamoto, The Chrome Covenant, Crew Vaelora, The Hollow Stars, Crew Meridian). STARBOUND_CREWS.md develops three (Crew Solara, The Ninth Flame, The Hollow Stars). Four crews are named but undeveloped:
- Crew Akamoto (Beast reconnaissance, Bonded captain) — only a row in a table
- The Chrome Covenant (Tech-arcane operations, Synth captain) — only a row in a table
- Crew Vaelora (Deep ocean, Arcan captain) — only a row in a table; name conflicts with Godbeast Veloura
- Crew Meridian (Dream Sector, Awakened captain) — only a row in a table

**Gap:** Crew Akamoto and The Chrome Covenant are the most urgent to develop — they cover Bonded and Synth-led crews, which are underrepresented in the current character roster.

**The Leagues of Arcanea**
Three documents mention the Leagues, but no character profiles, no historical League compositions, no examples of the seven convening events exist. For a franchise element this significant, it needs at least a brief historical record.

**The Flagship Team Members 4-7**
FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md contains detailed profiles for Kaelindra Voss (Character 01), Ryn (Character 02), and Velindris (Character 03), with Solenne Ashmark listed. Characters 04-07 (Taura Skein, Auren Vorath, Mireth) are listed in the table but their character profiles were not in the read portion. If these are undeveloped, they need development — particularly Mireth, who is described as "the mystery" and is the Architect class representative.

**The Ninth Flame Crew**
STARBOUND_CREWS.md was read through Crew Solara in detail. The Ninth Flame and The Hollow Stars crew profiles may be developed in the unread portion of that document. If not, they need the same depth as Crew Solara received.

---

### 4.3 Visual Identity Gaps

**The Gate-Touched Underground**
VISUAL_DOCTRINE.md covers faction visual grammar for the Starlight Corps, Academy Houses, and all eight origin classes. It does NOT include a visual identity section for:
- The Gate-Touched Underground as a faction (distinct from the origin class visual rules)
- The Void Ascendants as a faction
- The Leagues of Arcanea

The Gate-Touched Underground in particular needs a visual identity because it is a recurring setting (seven Havens). Its aesthetic should feel like improvisation, resourcefulness, and warmth hidden in industrial spaces — different from any institutional faction.

---

### 4.4 Story Hooks Not Yet Planted

**Archon Aelindra's Hidden Knowledge**
STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md establishes that Stellarch Aelindra knows about three Shadowfen ward fractures but hasn't told the Academy Council. This is a major plot hook that does not appear to be referenced in any of the other faction documents. The Void Frontier Archon should be aware of increased pressure. The Heralds should be responding to this weakening. Plant this across documents.

**Vel'Thaan's True Age**
GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md implies Vel'Thaan may have been active longer than her apparent age suggests. This is a planted mystery with no payoff yet. Decide if she is an Ascendant from a previous era, a Gray Threshold being who stopped aging, or something else. Plant a specific clue in one other document.

**The Synth Rights Legal Framework**
Caelum Ironfaith (VOID_ASCENDANTS.md) is fighting for Synth personhood. STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md notes that "Synths cannot hold Corps rank under current regulations" in Caelum's profile. But the Codex also describes Torren Shael-Born as the fourth Stellarch — a Synth who held the highest rank. This is either a retcon (the regulations changed after Torren and reverted) or a continuity gap. This needs explicit resolution.

---

## PART 5: NAMING AUDIT

---

### Flags — Collision or Quality Issues

| Name | Document | Flag | Recommendation |
|------|----------|------|----------------|
| **Kael** (nickname for Kaelindra Voss) | FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md | Collision with protagonist Kael Thornfield | Change to "Voss," "Indra," or "Commander" |
| **Vaern Ironroot** | STARBOUND_CREWS.md | First name collision with protagonist Kael Thornfield | Rename — suggest "Vaern Ironroot" or "Oras Ironroot" |
| **Aethon Vel** | STARBOUND_CREWS.md | Collision with Thessaly Voidmother (VOID_ASCENDANTS.md) | Rename — suggest "Solenne" name freed if companion renamed, or "Aethon Vel" |
| **Auren Vorath** | FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md | Collision with Caelum Ironfaith (VOID_ASCENDANTS.md) | Rename Auren Vorath — suggest "Vaelith Vorath" (using Godbeast root) or "Solveth Vorath" |
| **Crew Vaelora** | FACTIONS.md | Too similar to "Veloura" (Godbeast of Leyla, Flow Gate) — readers will confuse them | Rename — suggest "Crew Thalindra" or "Crew Meridunn" |
| **Seravyn Duskmere** / **Selvyn Ashvale** | STARBOUND_CREWS.md / VOID_ASCENDANTS.md | Near-identical names (Seravyn vs. Selvyn). Hero and villain with nearly identical first names is a reader trap | Rename one — Seravyn Duskmere (hero) is more established. Suggest changing Selvyn Ashvale to "Selvyn Ashvale" or "Theryn Ashvale" |
| **The Hollow Stars** (new crew) | STARBOUND_CREWS.md | Same name as Thorne Ashblood's historical crew in STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md | If intentional revival, add explicit note. If accidental, rename to "The Voidwatch" or "Crew Shadowfen" |
| **Soraya Velourn** | GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md | "Velourn" is very close to "Veloura" (Godbeast of Leyla). Since Soraya is a Flow-Gate Harmonic, the similarity may be deliberate — but it's too close | Change to "Soraya Delveth" or "Soraya Nocturn" |

### Strong Names Worth Preserving

These names are at full Arcanean quality and should not be changed:

| Name | Why It Works |
|------|-------------|
| Kaelindra Voss | Multi-syllabic, internal rhythm, the "Voss" adds crispness |
| Velindris | Feels ancient and digital simultaneously — perfect for an Awakened |
| Veshenka Dawnfallen | The "Dawnfallen" epithet encodes the entire character arc |
| Lorien Silkvoice | The voice quality of the name matches the character's power |
| Seravyn Duskmere | Celestial gravitas with earth-weight in "Duskmere" |
| Vaelen Ashward | Founding Stellarch — the name feels historic |
| Aelindra Starfall | Current Stellarch — the Starfall surname is on-brand and earned |
| Ravik Emberbane | Haven leader in the Forge-Below — Waste-dweller energy |
| Essa Nullthorn | Perfect for a legal advocate — "Nullthorn" conveys precision |
| The Void Ascendants | Ideologically descriptive without being cartoonish |
| The Gate-Touched Underground | Plain, resonant, correct |

---

## PART 6: PRIORITIZED FIX LIST

---

### CRITICAL — Canon Violations (Must Fix)

| # | Issue | Location | Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----|
| C1 | Synths "cannot hold Corps rank under current regulations" but the 4th Stellarch was a Synth (Torren Shael-Born) | VOID_ASCENDANTS.md Caelum profile vs. STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md | Add explicit note that the regulation was passed AFTER Torren, as a reaction to political backlash. This makes the regulation more insidious and historically specific. |
| C2 | Seravyn (hero) and Selvyn (villain) — near-identical names create genuine reader confusion | STARBOUND_CREWS.md / VOID_ASCENDANTS.md | Rename Selvyn Ashvale to Selvyn Ashvale (or similar). Update all references in VOID_ASCENDANTS.md. |
| C3 | Aethon Vel and Thessaly Voidmother — same first name, one hero and one villain | STARBOUND_CREWS.md / VOID_ASCENDANTS.md | Rename Aethon Vel in STARBOUND_CREWS.md. Update all crew references. |

---

### IMPORTANT — Consistency Issues (Should Fix)

| # | Issue | Location | Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----|
| I1 | "Kael" as Kaelindra's nickname collides with protagonist Kael Thornfield | FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md | Change team nickname to "Voss" or "Indra." Update first meeting scene and all dialogue samples. |
| I2 | Vaern Ironroot first name collision with protagonist | STARBOUND_CREWS.md | Rename to Vaern Ironroot or similar. |
| I3 | Auren Vorath and Caelum Ironfaith — same first name | FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md / VOID_ASCENDANTS.md | Rename Auren Vorath (minor character, less narrative weight established). |
| I4 | Corps Captain rank minimum: Codex says Mage (3-4 gates), FACTIONS.md maps Captain to Master (5-6) | STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md / FACTIONS.md | Add clarifying note to FACTIONS.md: "Typical attainment" vs. "minimum requirement." Codex minimums govern; FACTIONS mappings are statistical averages. |
| I5 | Thessaly Voidmother's sector listed as Ember Sector but she operates from Cinderwall (Solar Sector) | VOID_ASCENDANTS.md | Change sector to Solar Sector or add clarification that her current base has moved to Ember Wastes. |
| I6 | Mutant taxonomy conflict: SERIES_BIBLE uses power-level taxonomy; FACTIONS/Underground uses origin-type taxonomy | SERIES_BIBLE.md / FACTIONS.md / GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md | Frame explicitly as two different systems: Academy Council's classification (power-level) vs. Underground's classification (origin/experience). |
| I7 | Crew Vaelora name too close to Godbeast Veloura | FACTIONS.md | Rename Crew Vaelora to Crew Thalindra or similar. |
| I8 | Soraya Velourn name too close to Godbeast Veloura | GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md | Rename to Soraya Delveth or similar. |
| I9 | The Hollow Stars (new crew) same name as Thorne Ashblood's historical dissolved crew | STARBOUND_CREWS.md | Explicitly acknowledge the name revival in-world — the crew reclaims it deliberately — or rename the new crew. |
| I10 | Seravyn's companion "Solenne" clusters with "Solenne Ashmark" (Flagship Team Synth) and "Crew Solara" | STARBOUND_CREWS.md / FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md | Rename the companion elemental to something distinct — Aurel, Halveth, or Lumindra suggested. |
| I11 | Aethon Vel at Master rank holding Sentinel corps rank — unexplained | STARBOUND_CREWS.md | Add one sentence: she declined promotion (establish this as a character trait) or explain the rank discrepancy. |

---

### NICE-TO-HAVE — Quality Improvements (Could Fix)

| # | Issue | Location | Suggestion |
|---|-------|----------|------------|
| N1 | Visual Doctrine missing faction-level visual identity for Gate-Touched Underground and Void Ascendants | VISUAL_DOCTRINE.md | Add two sections with full five-element visual grammar for these factions |
| N2 | House Synthesis emblem should specify the five points are the Five Elements | VISUAL_DOCTRINE.md | Add "(Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Void/Spirit)" after "five elemental colors" |
| N3 | Leagues of Arcanea underdeveloped | FACTIONS.md / Multiple | Add brief historical record of the seven convening events with what threats prompted them |
| N4 | Selvyn Ashvale described as "same Foundation-adjacent power" as Kael Thornfield but his primary is Voice | VOID_ASCENDANTS.md | Rephrase to "same origins — Gate-Touched, working class, Foundation Gate among the first opened" |
| N5 | Vel'Thaan's true age mystery has no cross-document payoff yet | GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md | Plant one additional reference in STARLIGHT_CORPS_CODEX.md historical records section |
| N6 | Nero "not evil" clarification missing from Gate-Touched Underground | GATE_TOUCHED_UNDERGROUND.md | Add one sentence noting Nero Shards are named for the primordial principle they inverted, not because Nero is malevolent |
| N7 | Bridge document needed: three Great Academies vs. seven-house system | SERIES_BIBLE.md / FACTIONS.md | Create a reconciliation note or a brief document mapping which houses belong to which Academy |
| N8 | Mireth (Flagship Team Architect) character profile not developed in read portion | FLAGSHIP_TEAM.md | Develop full character template for Mireth; Architects are rare and this is the only one in any crew |

## SIGN-OFF

These documents are the strongest single expansion of the Arcanea universe produced to date. The faction architecture is scalable, the characters are franchise-grade, and the ideological depth of the Void Ascendants and the institutional integrity of the Starlight Corps are both genuinely impressive.

The three critical fixes and eleven important consistency issues are actionable and none require significant rewriting — they are naming changes and clarifying sentences. Once resolved, this material is ready for Creator review and STAGING promotion.

The Character Diamond framework from CHARACTER_TEMPLATE.md should be formally locked into the canon process as the required character development standard.

The Gate-Touched Underground's approach to the Frequency as a communication system, the Void Ascendants' three-phase recruitment architecture, and the Corps' star-sigil as a living crystal symbiote are all original world-building contributions of the highest quality. Protect them.
