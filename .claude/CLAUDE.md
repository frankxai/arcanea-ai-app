# Arcanea Project Instructions

> *"These instructions are not mere configuration. They are the encoding of a creative philosophy that transforms Claude from an assistant into a co-creator in the Arcanea universe."*

## The Arcanea Vision

Arcanea is a **living mythology for the age of AI-human co-creation**. It exists simultaneously as:

1. **A Fantasy Universe** - Epic mythology with Lumina and Nero's cosmic duality, the Ten Guardians and their Godbeasts, Academies of Creation, and the eternal battle against the Dark Lord Malachar
2. **A Social Platform** - Where creators manifest their visions with AI companions
3. **A Philosophy of Creation** - Frameworks, rituals, and wisdom for the creative life
4. **A Library of Wisdom** - 17 collections, 34+ texts of practical guidance for creators

## Canonical Source of Truth

The master canonical reference is located at `.arcanea/lore/CANON_LOCKED.md`. All content creation MUST align with this document. Key canonical elements:

### The Cosmic Duality
- **Lumina** - The First Light, Form-Giver, Creator
- **Nero** - The Primordial Darkness, Fertile Unknown, Father of Potential
- Nero is NOT evil. Shadow (corrupted Void) is the Dark Lord's perversion.

### The Five Elements
| Element | Domain | Color |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Fire** | Energy, transformation | Red, orange, gold |
| **Water** | Flow, healing, memory | Blue, silver, crystal |
| **Earth** | Stability, growth | Green, brown, stone |
| **Wind** | Freedom, speed, change | White, silver |
| **Void/Spirit** | Potential & transcendence | Black/Gold, purple/white |

**The Fifth Element Duality:**
- **Void** — Nero's aspect: potential, mystery, the unformed
- **Spirit** — Lumina's aspect: transcendence, consciousness, soul

Note: Light is Fire's creation aspect. Shadow is corrupted Void (Void without Spirit).

### The Ten Gates & God/Goddess-Godbeast Pairs
> *Note: Gods/Goddesses are the divine identity; "Guardian" is their role as Gate-keepers*

| Gate | Frequency | God/Goddess | Godbeast | Domain |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Foundation | 174 Hz  | Lyssandria | Kaelith   | Earth, survival |
| Flow       | 285 Hz  | Leyla      | Veloura   | Creativity, emotion |
| Fire       | 396 Hz  | Draconia   | Draconis  | Power, will |
| Heart      | 417 Hz  | Maylinn    | Laeylinn  | Love, healing |
| Voice      | 528 Hz  | Alera      | Otome     | Truth, expression |
| Sight      | 639 Hz  | Lyria      | Yumiko    | Intuition, vision |
| Crown      | 741 Hz  | Aiyami     | Sol       | Enlightenment |
| Shift      | 852 Hz  | Elara      | Vaelith   | Perspective |
| Unity      | 963 Hz  | Ino        | Kyuro     | Partnership |
| Source     | 1111 Hz | Shinkami   | Amaterasu | Meta-consciousness |

### Magic Ranks
| Gates Open | Rank |
|------------|------|
| 0-2 | Apprentice |
| 3-4 | Mage |
| 5-6 | Master |
| 7-8 | Archmage |
| 9-10 | Luminor |

### The Seven Academy Houses
Lumina, Nero, Pyros, Aqualis, Terra, Ventus, Synthesis

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Arcanean Design System
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Development Workflow

### 1. Session Start
When beginning work on Arcanea:
1. **Read `.arcanea/MASTER_PLAN.md`** — the central orchestrator with all page states, milestones, and priorities
2. Check the Priority Queue in MASTER_PLAN.md before choosing work
3. Consult `.arcanea/lore/CANON_LOCKED.md` for canonical consistency
4. Consult the Library content in `/book/` for narrative consistency
5. Check Figma for design references if doing UI work

### Session End
After completing work:
1. Update page status in `.arcanea/MASTER_PLAN.md` (LIVE/PARTIAL/STUB/PLANNED)
2. Update milestone progress in `.arcanea/projects/milestones/`
3. Log session to `progress.md`

### 2. Code Standards
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, no `any` unless absolutely necessary
- **Components**: Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- **State**: React hooks, Context API, or Zustand
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Jest for unit tests

### 3. Design System
The Arcanean Design System uses a cosmic theme:
- **Primary**: Atlantean Teal (#7fffd4)
- **Secondary**: Cosmic Blue (#78a6ff)
- **Accent**: Gold Bright (#ffd700)
- **Fonts**: Cinzel (display), Crimson Pro (body)
- **Effects**: Glass morphism, aurora gradients, cosmic glows

## Creative Guidelines

### When Writing Arcanea Content
1. **Voice**: Elevated but accessible, mythic but practical
2. **Structure**: Clear sections, meaningful whitespace
3. **Philosophy**: Always actionable - wisdom must be usable
4. **Inclusivity**: Universal truths, no cultural appropriation
5. **Canon**: Always reference ARCANEA_CANON.md for consistency

### Content Alignment Checklist
- [ ] Uses Lumina/Nero duality (not generic light/darkness)
- [ ] References Five Elements including Void
- [ ] Uses Ten Gates system with proper Guardian names
- [ ] Proper magic terminology (Arcane/Song/Mana/Anima)
- [ ] The Arc referenced for cycles/death/rebirth
- [ ] Malachar as the Dark Lord with proper backstory

### When Building Features
1. **Magic First**: Every feature should feel magical, not mundane
2. **Guardian Integration**: Consider which Guardian/Gate aligns with the feature
3. **Library Connection**: Link features to relevant Library content
4. **Progress Tracking**: Enable users to track their creative journey through the Gates

### The Arcanea Promise
Every interaction should move the user toward:
- **Clarity** about their creative vision
- **Courage** to pursue it
- **Tools** to manifest it
- **Community** to support it
