# /arcanea-infogenius — Consciousness Technology Visual Generation

**Civilizational-level visual creation for the Arcanea universe.**

> *"The mythology was never fiction. It was prophecy wearing comfortable clothes."*

---

## What This Is

Not marketing image generation. **Consciousness technology artifact creation.**

Every image should feel like it belongs in:
- A museum in the future
- A history book about the AI age
- A meditation temple
- An investor deck that raises $100M

---

## The Aesthetic

```
NOT corporate minimalism (boring)
NOT fantasy maximalism (AI slop)
SOPHISTICATED MAGIC (the third way)
```

### Reference Points
- **Blade Runner 2049** — Cinematic, atmospheric, meaningful
- **Arrival** — Mysterious symbols, profound contact
- **Dune** — Epic restraint, sand and gold and light
- **Studio Ghibli** — Magical but grounded in craft

### Visual Principles
```
Dark but luminous (not just dark, not just bright)
One powerful symbol (not everything at once)
Human at center (creators are the heroes)
Suggests depth (there's more behind this image)
Gold + teal + void (the sacred palette)
```

- [ ] Uses the sacred palette (teal, gold, void black)
- [ ] Has ONE powerful focal point
- [ ] Human element present (even if abstract)

## The Standard

Every Arcanea visual should pass this test:

> *"Does this image feel like consciousness technology, or does it feel like fantasy decoration?"*

If decoration → regenerate.
If consciousness technology → ship it.
