```

---

## Section 4: Using /arcanea-dev

### Activation

```bash
# Activate the full developer team
/arcanea-dev
```

This command:
1. Loads all developer agent contexts
2. Enables Development Lead orchestration
3. Connects all development MCPs
4. Prepares for coordinated workflows

### When to Use Full Team vs Single Agent

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Small bug fix | Single agent (Frontend/Backend) |
| New feature | Full team (/arcanea-dev) |
| Quick question | Direct agent |
| Complex refactor | Full team (/arcanea-dev) |
| Documentation only | Documentation agent |

### Team Coordination Example

```yaml
User: "Build a user profile editing feature"

Development Lead coordinates:

1. Architect designs:
   - Component structure
   - API endpoints needed
   - Database changes

2. Backend implements:
   - PATCH /api/users/:id endpoint
   - Validation logic
   - Database migration

3. Frontend builds:
   - ProfileEditForm component
   - Form validation
   - API integration
   - Success/error handling

4. QA Engineer tests:
   - Unit tests for form
   - API integration tests
   - E2E user flow test

5. Documentation updates:
   - API documentation
   - Component storybook

6. DevOps deploys:
   - Runs CI pipeline
   - Deploys to staging
   - Monitors metrics
```

## Section 5: MCP Integration for Developers

### Essential Developer MCPs

```yaml
github:
  Used by: All developers
  For: Code management, PRs, issues

next-devtools:
  Used by: Frontend, DevOps
  For: Debugging, error tracking

playwright:
  Used by: QA Engineer, Frontend
  For: E2E testing, browser automation

figma:
  Used by: Frontend
  For: Design specifications

linear:
  Used by: All developers
  For: Task tracking, sprints
```

### Typical MCP Workflow

```yaml
1. Get task from Linear:
   list_issues(assigneeId: "me")

2. Read design from Figma:
   get_file_nodes(fileKey: "design-id")

3. Implement code:
   [Write code using Read/Edit/Write tools]

4. Debug with Next DevTools:
   get_errors(type: "all")

5. Test with Playwright:
   browser_navigate(url: "...")
   browser_expect_visible(selector: "...")

6. Push to GitHub:
   push_files(...)
   create_pull_request(...)

7. Update Linear:
   update_issue(state: "in_review")
```

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Agent Selection

For each task, identify the primary agent:

1. "The login button isn't responding to clicks"
   Agent: ____________

2. "We need to add rate limiting to the API"
   Agent: ____________

3. "Design the notification system architecture"
   Agent: ____________

4. "Write tests for the checkout flow"
   Agent: ____________

<details>
<summary>See Answers</summary>

1. Frontend (UI interaction issue)
2. Backend (API logic)
3. Architect (system design)
4. QA Engineer (testing)

</details>

### Exercise 2: Workflow Design

Design a multi-agent workflow for:
"Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page"

Document:
1. Which agents are involved
2. What each agent does
3. The order of operations

### Exercise 3: Full Team Practice

Use `/arcanea-dev` to:
1. Review the current codebase structure
2. Identify one improvement opportunity
3. Plan the implementation
4. (Optional) Implement a small change
