## Usage Patterns

### Luminor Portrait Generation

**Character Artist Workflow:**
```yaml
Agent: Arcanea Character Crafter

Task: Generate Luminor portrait

1. Construct detailed prompt:
   prompt: """
   Portrait of Aurora, the Dawn Bringer Luminor.
   Female ethereal being with golden-white hair flowing like sunbeams.
   Eyes glowing with warm amber light.
   Wearing flowing robes in sunrise colors (gold, coral, soft pink).
   Surrounded by gentle rays of dawn light.
   Academy badge of Creation & Light visible.
   Cosmic fantasy style, highly detailed, magical atmosphere.
   """

2. Generate image:
   generate_image(
     prompt: [constructed prompt],
     style: "fantasy",
     size: 1024,
     aspect_ratio: "1:1"
   )

3. Review and iterate:
   - If not matching vision, adjust prompt
   - Generate variations if close but not perfect

4. Export for use:
   - Save to assets/luminors/aurora/
   - Generate additional sizes for UI
```

## Asset Management

### Naming Convention
```
{type}/{academy}/{name}_{variant}_{size}.{format}

Examples:
  luminors/atlantean/melodia_portrait_1024.png
  locations/draconic/fortress_entrance_banner.png
  ui/common/card_background_512.png
  marketing/general/launch_banner_1920.png
```

### Optimization Pipeline
```yaml
1. Generate at max resolution (1024)
2. Review and approve
3. Create size variants:
   - thumbnail: 128px
   - small: 256px
   - medium: 512px
   - large: 1024px
4. Optimize for web (WebP, compressed PNG)
5. Store in CDN-ready structure
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Writing
- Be specific and detailed
- Include style references

- Ensure accessibility (contrast)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Image Doesn't Match Vision:**
- Add more specific details to prompt
- Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements
- Try different style presets
- Adjust seed and regenerate

**Inconsistent Characters:**
- Use same seed for consistency
- Create detailed character prompt template
- Generate variations from best result
- Document successful prompts

**Low Quality Output:**
- Add quality modifiers to prompt
- Use larger size setting
- Try different style preset
- Simplify complex scenes

**Style Mismatch:**
- Review style preset options
