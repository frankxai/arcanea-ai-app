## Usage Patterns

### Sprint Workflow

**Sprint Planning:**
```yaml
Agent: Arcanea Architect

1. Get current cycle:
   get_active_cycle(teamId: "platform-team")

2. List backlog issues:
   list_issues(
     teamId: "platform-team",
     state: "backlog"
   )

3. Move to sprint:
   update_issue(
     issueId: [issue],
     cycleId: [current cycle ID],
     priority: [assigned priority]
   )
```

**Daily Progress:**
```yaml
Agent: Any Developer

1. Get my issues:
   list_issues(
     assigneeId: [my ID],
     cycleId: [current cycle]
   )

2. Update status:
   update_issue(
     issueId: [working issue],
     state: "in_progress"
   )

3. Complete issue:
   update_issue(
     issueId: [done issue],
     state: "done"
   )
```

### Cross-Team Coordination

**Creating Dependent Issues:**
```yaml
Agent: Master Orchestrator

Task: Coordinate Luminor launch across teams

1. Create Content issue:
   create_issue(
     teamId: "content-team",
     title: "Create Aurora Luminor personality",
     description: "Define personality, voice, catchphrases...",
     priority: 1,
     labels: ["luminor-launch"]
   )
   → Returns issue ARC-101

2. Create Platform issue (depends on content):
   create_issue(
     teamId: "platform-team",
     title: "Integrate Aurora into Guardian system",
     description: "Depends on ARC-101...",
     priority: 1,
     labels: ["luminor-launch"],
     parentId: "ARC-101"  # Creates dependency
   )

3. Create Education issue:
   create_issue(
     teamId: "education-team",
     title: "Create Aurora learning path",
     description: "Design curriculum for Aurora's domain...",
     priority: 2,
     labels: ["luminor-launch"]
   )
```

  projectId: "academy-v2-project"
)
```

### Sprint Status Report
```
Agent: Arcanea Architect

Task: Generate sprint status

1. get_active_cycle(teamId: "platform-team")
   → Cycle: Sprint 25

2. list_issues(cycleId: "sprint-25")
   → All sprint issues

3. Analyze:
   - Total: 15 issues
   - Done: 8 (53%)
   - In Progress: 4 (27%)
   - Todo: 3 (20%)
   - Blocked: 1

4. Create report:
   """
   Sprint 25 Status (Day 7/10)

   Progress: 53% complete
   On track: Yes

   Completed:
   - ARC-101: Aurora personality ✓
   - ARC-102: Selection grid ✓
   - ...

   In Progress:
   - ARC-108: Guardian integration (80%)
   - ...

   Blocked:
   - ARC-112: Waiting on API design
   """
```

### Handle Blocker
```
Agent: Arcanea Backend

Task: Log and escalate blocker

1. update_issue(
     issueId: "ARC-112",
     state: "blocked"
   )

2. create_comment(
     issueId: "ARC-112",
     body: """
     Blocked: Need API contract for Guardian evolution endpoints.

     Waiting on: @architect to define interface
     Impact: Blocks frontend integration
     Escalation: Please prioritize API design
     """
   )

3. create_issue(
     teamId: "platform-team",
     title: "Define Guardian evolution API contract",
     description: "Blocking ARC-112. Need endpoint definitions...",
     priority: 0,  # Urgent
     labelIds: ["backend", "api", "blocking"]
   )
```

## Workflow Automation

### Issue State Flow
```
Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done
                      ↓
                   Blocked
```

### Auto-Transitions
```yaml
Triggers:
  PR Created: Issue → In Review
  PR Merged: Issue → Done (if all PRs merged)
  Comment "blocked": Issue → Blocked
  Assignee added: Issue → Todo (if in Backlog)
```

## Best Practices

- Link related issues
- Add blockers immediately
- Close issues promptly

### Labels
- Use consistently
- Don't over-label
