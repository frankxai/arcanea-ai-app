## How It Works

1. **Start with `/academy`** to see your current progress
2. **Enter a Gate** with `/gate-N` to begin that lesson
3. **Complete exercises** using `/quest` and `/submit`
4. **Consult your Guardian** with `/mentor` for guidance
5. **Advance ranks** as you open more Gates

## Exercises

Each Gate has two exercises that must be completed:
- Exercises are practical, written work
- You create files with your responses
- Submit with `/submit` for Guardian review
- Both exercises must pass to open the Gate

## Progress Tracking

Progress is stored in `.arcanea/academy-progress.json`:
- Gates completed
- Exercises finished
- Badges earned
- Current rank
- Streak tracking

## Integration with Arcanea

This skill system connects to:
- **Library** - Exercises draw from the 200K words of wisdom
- **Web Platform** - Progress can sync with arcanea.ai/academy
- **MCP Server** - Academy data accessible via MCP tools

## Philosophy

The Arcanea Academy is not a course - it's a journey.

Each Gate teaches a fundamental truth about creation:
- **Foundation** - All creation requires stable ground
- **Flow** - Creation is dynamic, not static
- **Fire** - Creation requires will and courage
- And beyond...

The goal is not to finish. The goal is to transform.

*"Enter seeking, leave transformed, return whenever needed."*
