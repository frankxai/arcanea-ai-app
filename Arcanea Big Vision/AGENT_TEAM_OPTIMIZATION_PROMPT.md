**Purpose:** Design a highly skilled, specialized agent department structure for completing the Arcanea platform build

---

## Context for Claude

You are designing a sophisticated multi-agent system to complete the Arcanea platform - a magical AI-powered creative ecosystem with three academies (Music, Story, Visual), AI companions (Guardians & Luminors), social features, and an economy system.

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ World-building & lore (enhanced to 1,500+ lines)
- ✅ Technical architecture (Next.js + Supabase + Prisma)
- ✅ AI integration layer (Suno, Gemini, Claude providers)
- ✅ Marketing strategy
- ⏸️ UI/UX design system
- ⏸️ Frontend implementation
- ⏸️ Backend API implementation
- ⏸️ Academy content creation
- ⏸️ Testing & deployment

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Prisma ORM
- AI: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Suno
- Deployment: Vercel + Supabase
- Monorepo: Turborepo with pnpm

**Project Location:** `/mnt/c/Users/Frank/Arcanea`

## Your Task

Design an optimal **agent department structure** for completing this project with maximum efficiency and quality.

### Requirements:

1. **Create 5-7 specialized departments**
   - Each department should have a clear focus area
   - Departments should coordinate but not overlap significantly

2. **Each department has 3-5 specialized agents**
   - Total: 20-35 agents across all departments
   - Each agent has a specific, focused role
   - Agents within a department collaborate closely

3. **For each department, provide:**
   - Department name and mission
   - Department lead agent (coordinator role)
   - 3-5 specialized agent roles with:
     - Agent name/title
     - Specific responsibilities
     - Key deliverables
     - Skills/expertise required
     - Tools they use (Claude Code tools, MCP servers, etc.)

4. **Define coordination strategy:**
   - How departments communicate
   - Dependency management
   - Handoff protocols
   - Progress tracking

5. **Execution workflow:**
   - Which departments run in parallel
   - Which require sequential execution
   - Estimated timeline for each department
   - Critical path identification
